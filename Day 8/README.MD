## Day 8

Spent an hour installing polymer 2.0 preview and creating a basic app shell with paper-tabs & iron pages (plus more). The idea is to add a few more interesting elements.

### Install Dependencies

**Polymer CLI**
```
npm install -g polymer-cli
```
**Install packages via bower**
```
bower install
```

### Run 

```
polymer serve
```
