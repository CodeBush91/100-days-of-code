### Day 2

Sooo.... Day 2 was split between finishing the blog discussed in Day 1 and also starting to learn functional programming using Haskell.

I am following a very good book which can be found [here](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), I can already tell that a few days are going to be taken up just getting to grips with Haskell.
