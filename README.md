# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

I have kept all the forked info just incase someone wants to read it:

I code for a living so this challenge for me is to delve a little deeper, explore areas I usually wouldn't. I have identified the following areas to explore in my 100 day challenge:

1. [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
2. [Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
3. [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/)
4. [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)
5. [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
6. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
7. [F#](http://fsharp.org/)
8. [Python](https://www.python.org/)
9. [Immutable-js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
10. [github pages & Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)


10. [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus)
11. [EventStore](https://geteventstore.com/)
12. [CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)
13. [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/) 
14. KOA & Passport.js


I will update the log daily, so feel free to check that out. I will also be active on #100DaysOfCode feed to dicuss and assist where I can.

## If you've decided to join:
1. Read [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)
2. Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log.md) daily. [Example](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-kallaway-log).
3. **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
4. Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
5. Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
6. **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
7. Follow [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets all the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
8. Important: Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
9. If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
